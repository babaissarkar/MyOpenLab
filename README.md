# MyOpenLab
Java based Software for Graphical Programming. In particular, MyOpenLab seems to be widely used to develop control programs that can run on Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards. 
Though MyOpenLab may behave a bit like LabVIEW, it is based on Java and has an internal structure that is completely different.
MyOpenLab has an architecture that is not oriented around flow programming; it is what?s called event driven. In event-driven programs, events determine the flow of the program. 
Typical events include mouse clicks, key presses, and messages from other programs. Perhaps for obvious reasons, graphical user interfaces typically are built around event-driven architectures.

For Linux and MAC first open a Linux Terminal.
Use the "cd" command to Change the working directory and set your distribution Folder. (Example: cd /home/yourpath/distribution).
Execute "./start_****" Script. ("***" according to the OS Arch) (You must Add Execution privileges to the "start" Script).

For Linux Ubuntu you can use .desktop too if you edit it and update the distribution patch.
For Raspberry you can add execution privilieges to the start_linux script and run it with double click.

For Windows Please use "start.bat".
